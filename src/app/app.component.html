            Sury, originally from Camagüey, Cuba, has dedicated her career to
            supporting children with special needs. Her passion for this field
            emerged early in life, guiding her to pursue a bachelor's degree in
            Special Education from the University of Camagüey, where she
            graduated with honors.
          </p>

            initiatives to raise awareness about autism, most notably leading
            the "Esperanza Azul" project in 2014. She also gained practical
            experience by working part-time at a school for children with autism
            during her final two years of college.
          </p>
          <p>
